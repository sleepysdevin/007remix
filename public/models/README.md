# 3D Models

Place GLB, GLTF, or VRM files here. Supported subfolders:

- **enemies/** — Enemy character models (guards, soldiers, etc.)
- **players/** — Player avatar models (for first/third person)
- **characters/** — Shared character assets (can be used for both)

Example: `enemies/guard.glb`, `players/agent.vrm`, `characters/custom.glb`
