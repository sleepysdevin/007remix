# Standalone Animations

Drop Mixamo (or compatible) animation GLBs here to apply them to VRM/GLB enemy and character models.

**Supported files:**
- `idle.glb`
- `walk.glb`
- `run.glb`
- `death.glb`
- `attack.glb`
- `hit.glb`

Use Mixamo exports with standard bone names; animations are retargeted to VRM humanoid bones automatically. Missing files are skipped.
